system complicated

1. customer paid amount in order data

customer paid amount not matched -> if, one customer purchase 3 product with 2 vendor. Then, our system will generate 2 order id. so that, how I will calculate exact customer paid amount on this order. Because of, customer paid at once, but, order devided by 2 vendors.

2. only Consultant commission amount show as per order. not possible, to show per consultant name wise exact amount. Because, 1 existing product available on the user cart using another consultant, and, new product will purchase from another consultant.
